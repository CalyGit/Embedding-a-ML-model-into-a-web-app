## About

Welcome to the Customer Churn Prediction App! This interactive web application uses a machine learning model to predict customer churn in a subscription-based service. The app is built using Streamlit and provides an easy-to-use interface for predicting customer behavior.

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies (see Installation section below).
2. Run the Streamlit app: `streamlit run app.py`.
3. Input customer information and preferences.
4. Click the "Predict" button to receive the prediction.

The app will then display whether the customer is likely to churn or stay based on the provided inputs.
