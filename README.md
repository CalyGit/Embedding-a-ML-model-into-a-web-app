</p>
Welcome to the Gradio Machine Learning Model Embedding Project using Gradio! This project demonstrates how to embed a machine learning model to predict store sales across different stores of Corporation Favorita, a grocery store chain in Ecuador. The Gradio app provides an interactive interface for users to input variables and obtain sales forecasts.

### Usage

To use the Gradio app for store sales prediction, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies (see Installation section below).
2. Run the Gradio app: `python sales_forecast_app.py`.
3. Input relevant variables for date, store number, promotion status, year, cluster, and daily oil price.
4. Click the "Submit" button to receive the sales forecast.

The app will display the predicted sales for the specified input variables as shown in the image above.

### Installation

To run the Gradio app locally for store sales prediction, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git`
2. Navigate to the project folder: `cd your_repository`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

</p>
Welcome to the Streamlit Machine Learning Model Embedding Project using Streamlit. This project demonstrates how to embed a machine learning model to predict customer churn for Vodafone Telecom, a telecommunications company. The Streamlit app provides an interactive interface for users to input customer information and get churn predictions.

### Usage

To use the Streamlit app for customer churn prediction, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies (see Installation section below).
2. Run the Streamlit app: `streamlit run app.py`.
3. Input customer details such as contract duration, monthly charges, total charges, etc.
4. Click the "Predict" button to receive the churn prediction.

The app will display whether the customer is likely to churn or stay based on the provided inputs.
